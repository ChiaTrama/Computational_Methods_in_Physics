# **Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation in 1-D with Periodic Boundary Conditions and Step Potential**

**Comparison of Propagators: Explicit Euler, Crank–Nicolson, Verlet, with and without Wavefunction Renormalization during Dynamics**

This project implements several numerical methods to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for a particle in one dimension (1-D) with periodic boundary conditions and a step potential. The code compares the effectiveness of three different propagators:

1. **Explicit Euler Method**
2. **Crank–Nicolson Method**
3. **Stormer–Verlet Method**
